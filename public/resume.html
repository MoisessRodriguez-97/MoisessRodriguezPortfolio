    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Northrop Grumman</h3>
    <h4>Software Engineer, 08/2022 – Present</h4>
    <p>Developed new software features to pre-existing frameworks to improve the functionality of aeronautic subsystems. Created unit tests to test new features. Verified new features integrated correctly with source code by utilizing a continuous integration and deployment tool called Bamboo. Participated in code reviews with colleagues, managers, product owners, and Software Quality Assurance to merge in new changes with source code. Worked independently to create a GUI interface for Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) power supply. Maintained and created system architecture documentation for pre-existing and new products. Fixed errors in pre-existing embedded systems frameworks and merged the corrected code to the source repository. Worked directly with program managers and subject matter experts to create new embedded software for a Laser Range Finder (LRFD). Performed presentations and discussions with product owners and leadership to discuss new implementation.</p>
    <h4>Associate Software Engineer, 08/2021 – 08/2022</h4>
    <p>Utilized proprietary libraries and tools to develop mission critical software in C++. Tested and debugged aeronautic subsystems in python and java. Performed demonstrations of new software features to colleagues. Verified architecture models in Rhapsody. Updated, created, and implemented requirements for the systems architecture in DOORS. Utilized Atlassian tools to adhere to Agile workflow.</p>
    <h4>Associate Software Engineer Intern, 05/2020 – 08/2020</h4>
    <p>Created listeners to receive XML messages which were sent from proprietary tools. Extracted data from XML messages and sent them to a raspberry pi via Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Sent XML messages through a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), to a Raspberry PI interface (RPI) which controlled motors and LEDs on carriage and doors. Programmed the Raspberry Pi to enable the I2C protocol in order to connect a multiplexor (MUX) to gain additional pins. Downloaded required libraries to the RPI offline to follow security guidelines. Connected servos to the MUX and controlled them by configuring the added pins.</p>
    <h3>NASA</h3>
    <h4>Software Developer Intern, 05/2018 – 08/2018</h4>
    <p>Assisted NASA’s ES52 department with completing Flight Software (FSW) related tasks, along with collaborating with other interns/engineers to develop solutions, and project managed events. Observed and implemented Google’s TensorFlow to generate a model that implements Artificial Intelligence (AI), or more specifically Machine Learning (ML) to enhance workflow efficiency. ML achieved this by using data to train with, and then predict an outcome which helps detect anomalies within the data, that is gathered from launch simulations.</p>
